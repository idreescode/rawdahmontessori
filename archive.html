                                        <p>We believe that these pressures are not good for children and their development. Assessment data and grades are personal to the student. Their progress is determined by their interests and efforts and working at a pace which matches their cognitive ability. There should be no pressures and rivalry between the learners, our multi age setting encourages children to learn from one another on a regular basis.</p>

                                        <p>The Rawdah spirituality and ethos is based on Abrahamic beliefs, traditions and teachings as explained in the last monotheistic religion, Islam. Our students also learn about other world religions, such as Christianity & Judaism. We have first class prayer facilities located onsite in a beautiful gothic building which the students can use throughout the day for reflection.</p>
                                        <p>Students are encouraged to be balanced in their characters, to avoid extremities, embrace diversity and learn how to respect and tolerate opinions which may differ to theirs.  Students also learn about their British heritage, values and history.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of lifestyles, we encourage our students to eat healthy, grow their own fruit and vegetables onsite, avoid sugary and processed snacks and fizzy drinks. Students have access to drinking water from fountains in education spaces. All of our students are involved in games and sport.</p>
